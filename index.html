        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive</li>
          <li>String: This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
          <li>Number: This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them</li>
          <li>Boolean(True/False): This is a true/false value. the words true and false are special keywords that do not need quote marks</li>
          <li>array: This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li>object: This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.</li>
          <li>Comments: Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>/*
            Everything in between is a comment.
            */</li>
            <li>// This is a comment</li>
            <ul><li>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this</li></ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Operators: An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Addition: Add two numbers together or combine new strings (+)</li>
            <li>Subtraction, Multiplication, Division: These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math</li>
            <li>Assignment: Assigns a value to a variable</li>
            <li>Strict equality: This performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.</li>
            <li>not, Does-not-equal: This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Conditionals: Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Functions: A function is a code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a variable that refers to the function.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>anonymous function:function without a function name. Only function expressions can be anonymous, function declarations must have a name</li></ul>
            <li>A named function is a function with a function name.</li>
            <li>An inner function is a function inside another function</li>
            <li>An outer function is a function containing a function</li>
            <li>A recursive function is a function that calls itself.</li>
            <li>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a function that is called directly after the function is loaded into the browser's compiler.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The way to identify an IIFE is by locating the extra left and right parenthesis at the end of the function's definition.</li>
            </ul>
            <li></li>
