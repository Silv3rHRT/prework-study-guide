# Prework Study Guide

## Description

As a new programmer, I wanted to create a study guide website from scratch to put all of the skills into practice as I was learning them. This was built to keep my notes organized through my prework so I or anyone else could easily access these simple notes to make their lives a bit easier for quick access.

## Usage

This guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. If you open dev tools on chrome you can check the console to randomly select a topic for you to read over if you want to brush up on something at random. Some easy annotations of codes and what they do will also be easily accessed incase you don't have another cheatsheet available.
